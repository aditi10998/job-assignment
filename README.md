Jr Data Scientist - Evaluation -1

Write about any difficult problem that you solved. (According to us difficult - is something which 90% of people would have only 10% probability in getting a similarly good solution). 
Till today,I thought that my most difficult proble i solved was my unsupervised project.But now my views are totally changed.This is my first interview and I was confident about my skills for data science.But after this task i got to know that it is very difficult.From my perspective this is the most difficult task till now.I studied nlp day and night for 5 days and still i am unable to complete the task.I only solved two problems but I got to learn a lot from it.I didn't managed to solve it completely.But,In future I will brush up my skills and try to again apply to NextLabs again in Future.I understand that this is not the difficult problem completely.But for me this is lesson for me.To improve my skills.
